First of all, I want to thank the Masai school for giving me this opportunity to work on a collaborative project and enhance my coding skills.
we learned a lot while working on this project. we failed so many times and we never give up, in the last we finally made our Project successfully.

*In the construct week.*

This is our Third collaborative project from the Masai school, and we got only 1 week to complete it, 
so it was a challenging journey for us. we faced a lot of challenges because some things are new to us and 
we have to complete it on time, so we first decide to study our website and then divide our work. we learned a lot while working together, 
we failed a lot of times but we never give up, we used to help each other solve the problems of our project, and in the last, we finally made our project successfully.

*Description of Project.*

The Masai school give our team to clone the website Mine Wine. 
Mine Wine is a popular Wine's company known for its minimalist and clean Wine's quality. They sell a variety of Wine's, and they have an online store where you can browse and purchase their products.
we gave our best to clone this website.

Git and Github.

Git: Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows
Github: GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its features.
https://github.com/Vikaschaturvedi167/WineShop_project this is our project git hub link.
We all became proficient in reading the code of team members. and we learned How to work and communicate with a team. and how to keep motivated each other throughout the problems.


*At last, I would like to thank our mentors and my team members for their support & guidance during the project.*
